To access the portfolio, <a href="https://lly03.github.io/">Click Here</a>!

This portfolio contains information about me and the work that I have accomplished. It's centered for Front-end development and UX/UI design. This portfolio is coded in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. The assets in the case studies are either screenshoted for my research at that time, or exported from Figma which were designed by me. For icons I used <a href="https://remixicon.com/">Remixicon</a>, and the font I used the google font <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins">Poppins</a>.
